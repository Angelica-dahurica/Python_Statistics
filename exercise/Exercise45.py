# A large farm wants to try out a new type of fertilizer to evaluate whether it will improve the farm's corn production.
# The land is broken into plots that produce an average of 1.215 pounds of corn with a standard deviation of 94 pounds per plot.
# The owner is interested in detecting any average difference of at least 40 pounds per plot.
# How many plots of land would be needed for the experiment if the desired power level is 90%? Assume each plot of land gets treated with either the current fertilizer or the new fertilizer.
